Project: Stock Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

Description:
This project aims to analyze and predict stock market movements by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques on financial news and social media data. The core idea is to capture investor sentiment from textual data sources such as news headlines, financial reports, and tweets, and correlate it with stock price fluctuations.

The workflow involves data collection (financial news, Twitter API, stock market datasets), text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization), and sentiment labeling (positive, negative, neutral). Various ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LSTMs are trained to classify sentiment. The sentiment scores are then mapped against stock price changes to identify potential trading signals.

By combining market sentiment with historical stock trends, the system provides insights into how public opinion and news affect stock performance. The model can assist traders, investors, and analysts in making more informed decisions.

Key Features:

Data scraping from financial news portals and Twitter API.
